    <p>After building and validating the prototype, we began building the Alpha release of Self Service.

    We had validated the product, we explored the features and settled on an MVP, but we were asked to strip down our feature set further to get the product to market as quickly as possible. We had an Alpha release scheduled for the end of April, with general availability set for the beginning of August.


    I spent my time supporting the developers and working with them on designing the finer points of the application. The real challenge was pairing back the features without sacrificing the usability and value of the product.

    Our Product Manager managed the early access program (EAP) which consisted of several existing RightScale customers. I assisted him during the bi-weekly reviews with the participants, where we demo'ed upcoming features, and recieved valuable feedback while we were in active development.
