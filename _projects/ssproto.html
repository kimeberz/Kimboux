    <p><em>RightScale had been a leader in Cloud Management solutions, but we wanted to start catering to a new set of users. Product gave me a high level overview of what the product needed to accomplish, and pointed me towards a few competing applications to get a better understanding of what we needed to build.</em></p>

    <p>
    <ul>Research Goals:
        <li>What problems do our customers need us to solve with this new product?</li>
        <li>How are they currently solving these problems?</li>
        <li>Who are the intended users?Â </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    We began our research cycle with discovery interviews. The Product Manager interviewed 10-15 customers, and during these sessions I was able to ask my own questions while also listening to what the customers needed from this product.</p>

    <p>Patterns began to emerge during the research phase. Many customers had a homegrown solution, others were using complementary products to supplement RightScale, and many were left to devise creative workarounds to solve this gap in the product.
    </p>

    <p>
    These early interviews were critical to learning exactly what our users wanted and needed. Additionally, by asking specific questions about their workflow, I was able to glean insight from their motivations, patterns, and behaviors that led to designing the right solution.

    <p>
    I expanded products vision in to personas, user stories and task flows. We knew there would be 3 main users of Self Service, but for purposes of the prototype we would only design and test the end users experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>User Tasks
            <li>Browse the curated Catalog for Cloud Applications</li>
            <li>Launch a Cloud Application</li>
            <li>Use the Cloud Application</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>Goals for Success
            <li>Give our users an easier product to consume the powerful features of the RightScale platform. </li>
            <li>This was broken down into several key value propositions:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give Admins a portal to design, maintain, curate, and publish Cloud Applications to a Marketplace where users can consume the set of resources; </li>
                    <li>and give untrained users the tools they need to utilize these cloud resources with little to no training required.</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>
    I took the product vision, user stories, task flows, and all the feedback and thoughts I had heard from our customers and created a simple axure prototype. I still had many hypotheses regarding the users needs, so I tried to design the app in a way that would lend itself to feedback around those questions.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Product Manager needed the prototype to show at the AWS Re:invent conference. From the business goals he gave me, I then wrote a concise script for him to read thru during the event.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here is the Usability Test script that I posted on our internal Wiki. As always, it was helpful to see where our hypotheses were on the mark, and where we needed to make adjustments.
