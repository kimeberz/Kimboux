    Research Goals:
    <li>What problems do we need to solve with this new product?</li>
    <li>How are customers currently solving these problems?</li>
    <li>Who are the intended users?</li>
    </p>

    We began our research cycle with discovery interviews. The Product Manager interviewed 10-15 customers, and during these sessions I was able to ask my own questions while also listening to what the customers needed from this product.</p>

    We quickly began seeing patterns during this early research phase. Many customers had a homegrown solution, others were using complementary products to supplement RightScale, and many were left to devise creative workarounds to solve this gap in the product.

    These early interviews were critical to learning exactly what our users wanted and needed. Additionally, by asking specific questions about their workflow, I was able to glean insight from their motivations, patterns, and behaviors that led to designing the right solution.

    Product then channeled the findings into a high level vision statement:

    “A Self-Service portal that enables end-users within the enterprise to request, provision, and manage services (resources) that have been defined and constrained by administrators, all within the purview of management.”

    I expanded this vision in to personas, user stories and task flows. We knew there would be 3 main users of Self Service, but for purposes of the prototype we would only design and test the end users experience.

    Design

    I took the product vision, user stories, task flows, and all the feedback and thoughts I had heard from our customers and created a simple axure prototype. I still had many hypothesis regarding the users needs, so I tried to design the app in a way that would lend itself to feedback around those questions.

    The Product Manager needed the prototype to show at the AWS Re:invent conference. From the business goals he gave me, I then wrote a script for him to read thru during
