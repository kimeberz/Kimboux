<h4>Project Goal: build a prototype to show at AWS Re:invent 2013</h4>
<h4>Project Timeline: 3 weeks</h4>

    <p><em>RightScale had been a leader in Cloud Management solutions, but we wanted to start catering to a new set of users. Product gave me a high level overview of what the product needed to accomplish, and pointed me towards a few competing applications to get a better understanding of what we needed to build.</em></p>

    <h4>Research</h4>
    <ul>Research Goals:
        <li>What problems do our customers need us to solve with this new product?</li>
        <li>How are they currently solving these problems?</li>
        <li>Who are the intended users?Â </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    We began our research cycle with discovery interviews. The Product Manager interviewed 10-15 customers, and during these sessions I was able to ask my own questions while also listening to what the customers needed from this product.</p>

    <p>Patterns began to emerge during the research phase. Many customers had a homegrown solution, others were using complementary products to supplement RightScale, and many were left to devise creative workarounds to solve this gap in the product.
    </p>

    <p>
    These early interviews were critical to learning exactly what our users wanted and needed. Additionally, by asking specific questions about their workflow, I was able to glean insight from their motivations, patterns, and behaviors that led to designing the right solution.

    <p>
    I synthesized our research in to personas, user stories and task flows. We knew there would be 3 main users of Self Service, but for purposes of the prototype we would only design and test the end users experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        <ul>User Tasks:
            <li>Browse the curated Catalog for Cloud Applications</li>
            <li>Launch a Cloud Application</li>
            <li>Use the Cloud Application</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>Goals for Success:
            <li>Give our users an easier product to consume the powerful features of the RightScale platform. </li>
            <li>This was broken down into several key value propositions:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give Admins a portal to design, maintain, curate, and publish Cloud Applications to a Marketplace where users can consume the set of resources; </li>
                    <li>and give untrained users the tools they need to utilize these cloud resources with little to no training required.</li>
                </ul>

        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>
    I then synthesized all of the requirements above into an axure prototype. I still had many assumptions and questions about the users needs, so I tried to design the app in a way that would lend itself to exploring those questions.
    </p>

    <div class="modal-caption">Here are two iterations of the Axure prototype. I did an A/B test between a launch modal and a launch Page.</div>

    <p>
    Our team then worked collaboratively to build the HTML prototype using my Axure prototype as a guide. After a few weeks we were ready to get some feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now back to our original goal - the Product Manager needed the prototype to show at the AWS Re:invent conference. From the business goals he gave me, I then wrote a script for him to read through during his conversations with customers.

    <div class="modal-caption">The usability test report that I wrote and posted on our internal wiki pages.</div>

    <p>
    While the Product team was busy at the conference, I was so eager to get feedback that I also ran a set of usability tests with 5 internal users of RightScale. I soon heard back from the Product Manager that our customers could not wait to start using our new application. I found that internal users shared the same excitement.
