    <p>After building and validating the <a href="#ssprotoModal" class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal">prototype</a>, we began building the Alpha release of Self Service.</p>

    <p>We had validated the product, we explored the features and settled on an MVP, but we were asked to strip down our feature set further to get the product to market as quickly as possible. We had an Alpha release scheduled for the end of April, with general availability set for the beginning of August.</p>

    <p>
    I spent my time supporting the developers and working with them on designing the finer points of the application. The real challenge was pairing back the features without sacrificing the usability and value of the product.</p>

    <p>
    During the phase of building the prototype, we focused on the end user. For Alpha, we  needed to shift focus to the Admins and Designers.</p>

    <ul>User Tasks for Admins and Designers
    <li>Efficiently provide users access to a curated set of Cloud Resources.</li>
    <li>Be a point of support for end users if CloudApps fail.</li>
    <li>Manage users, sharing and permissions. Grant users access to Self Service without providing access to the RightScale Cloud Management platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our Product Manager managed the early access program (EAP) which consisted of several existing RightScale customers. I assisted him during the bi-weekly reviews with the participants, where we demonstrated upcoming features, and recieved valuable feedback while we were in active development.</p>

    <div class="modal-caption">We wanted to make the publishing experience as efficient as possible for the Admins, so we gave them a way to test their CloudApps before publishing them to the Catalog. Here in the Designer app you can see the Designer can preview the launch modal that the end users will see in the catalog.</div>

    <div class="modal-caption">It is important for our users to make this portal feel like thier own, so we built the UI Customization app.</div>
