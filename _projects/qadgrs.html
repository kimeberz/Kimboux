<h2>QAD Global Requisition System</h2>

    <p>Key stakeholders at QAD decided that we needed to release a mobile application. Managers and Executives use the global requisition system to approve and route purchase requests. We were frequently hearing from our users about the different workarounds that they were dealing with to handle approving, denying and rerouting these requisitions while they were out of the office. It was clear that a mobile solution was needed.</p>

    <h4>Design Process</h4>
    <p>Being that no one on my team had used GRS, I took it upon myself to learn the system. This was my first project at QAD where work began with a user centered design process, rather than analyzing the outcome and mitigating the usability problems. For me, this was very exciting. I quickly found that there were parts of the system that just did not sync up with our users mental model, and it was astoundingly unintuitive. I scoured through the 20 year old documentation, trying to make sense of things. I was quickly dubbed the GRS expert of QAD, yet I remained unsatisfied with what was still little understanding. I decided to talk to internal users. I asked them to walk me through their workflow and explain the parts that were unclear to me. I quickly found out that it was equally unclear to them, and I found some very interesting workarounds they had employed to simply push a requisition through the system. They didn’t know why it acted this way, and they didn’t ask questions. This fascinated me. People using a system for over 10 years, aware of their lack of understanding, yet they brushed it off and were content with not fully understanding it.</p>

    <h4>Execution and Meausuring Success</h4>
    <p>After thorough research and speaking with the internal users, I was able to channel all the requirements in to a simple solution. We validated the app with our internal users, and external ones as well. Our users were delighted with the solution, and they finally had a product that helped them to better understand the system. It improved their workflow by reducing 5+ steps to complete a task, and allowed them to use the system no matter where they were in the world.</p>
