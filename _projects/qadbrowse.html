    <p>After the success of our first mobile application (GRS, shown below) we got overwhelming response from our user base for more apps. We ran a few surveys, analyzed our usage data, got weigh in from key stakeholders, and conducted user research across our user base to decide which application to build next. Our research showed that a mobile browse application would provide the most utility for our users. Our browses allow our users to view large datasets across their enterprise. Additionally, the browses can be customized and linked to one another to make meaningful connections.</p>

    <div class="modal-caption">We built a master-detail pattern that allowed the user to view more about an item, and then drill down to another browse with more details. </div>

    <h4>Design Process</h4>
    <p>Working closely with the lead front end developer, we began designing the Mobile Browse app. We started out by listing out user requirements, task flows, and key features that we needed to support on a mobile device. Because of time and technical constraints, we were pushed to focus on the minimum viable product.</p>

    <p>We quickly drafted up some paper prototypes, put them in front of key stakeholders and internal users. We continued to iterate on the designs and features from this research and feedback.</p>

    <div class="modal-caption">We wanted to implement a search widget that was similar to the desktop experience. This was a powerful search tool that our users were very pleased with.</div>

    <h4>Measuring Success</h4>
    <p>Our app was scheduled to release soon after a QAD user group meetup, so I proposed a research session during the conference. I was able to conduct in person usability testing on the app, and gathered valuable feedback that we were able to incorporate before releasing the app. Our users were thrilled with the application, and to help us with deciding what to build next. Not only did we find several opportunities for usability improvements by testing with our users, but we also brought that excitement and validation from our users back to our development team at QAQ.</p>
