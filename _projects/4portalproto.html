    <p>The Portal Prototype was an integral part of moving QAD’s Desktop Application to the web. Our goals for building the prototype were to explore and answer these questions: what is the minimum viable product (MVP) for our users with respect to a web application? What kind of complex interactions, features and functionality can we now take advantage of if we move to the web? Is this something our users want, or are they comfortable with on premise desktop software?</p>

    <p>Our team consisted of a one front end developer, a business analyst, and myself as the UX Designer. The Business Analyst was in Europe, so collaborating was challenging. He helped us with the content, and the front end dev and myself worked on designing the visual design, layout, interactions, and information architecture. We set mini releases each week, and tested the new functionality and designs 1-2 times per week. We found that the steady research cadence sped up our design work flow, quickly reduced usability problems, and improved user satisfaction.</p>

    <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
    <p>During the 8-10 weeks of working on the prototype, we surfaced invaluable information. More importantly, as the months went on, we continued learning from the prototype. It was instrumental in deciding how to move forward with a web application. From our thorough user research, we knew what features mattered most to our users. We knew that we had to focus on specific pain points they were currently working around because we didn’t have enough mobile solutions. This was great for our team, and a powerful tool for selling our story to other stakeholders. Listen to thy user research!</p>
