    <p>QAD provides Enterprise Resource Planning solutions. The Desktop application needed a Dashboard to give users an at-a-glance view of important data.</p>

    <p>I began the project with thorough user research. To get representative user data, I conducted onsite contextual inquiries to observe our users workflows. Coupled with competitive analysis, and analyzing user data, I began mapping out our users needs.
    </p>

    <ul>User Stories:
        <li>I need a Dashboard to get an at-a-glance view of all my important data.</li>
        <li>I need the data to be up to date.</li>
        <li>I need to be able to update the Dashboard as needed.</li>
        <li>I need to be able to share out my Dashboard with other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>We then created Dashboards for various roles, a few of the personas we designed for:
        <li>Customer Service Representative</li>
        <li>Account Manager</li>
        <li>Sales Representative</li>
        <li>Warehouse Manager</li>
        <li>+ 14 more</li>
    </ul>
    <p>From these Personas, we then contacted several customers that had offices near by and validated the Dashboards with them. We wanted to make sure that we understood our users needs, as this Dashboard project was part of a much bigger undertaking - a Role based system.</p>

    <p>Sidenote: From all this research, I hosted a local UX meetup event to talk on the subject of Role Based ERP systems. http://www.meetup.com/SB-UX-Meetup/events/107552412/</p>


    <p>The Dashboard allows users to add content from several program types across the platform. These included data tables, Operational Metrics, Business Intelligence Charts, Process Maps, and any URL they desired.</p>

    <h4>Measuring Success</h4>
    <p>We validated the Dashboard with several customers by allowing them to be part of an early adopter program. By participating in the program, we got continuous feedback during the development cycle that we were able to rapidly iterate on. Our customers were very pleased by the new features, and being part of the design process.</p>
