                    Product gave me a high level overview of what we needed to build, and I started my research from that vision statement. I conducted competitive analysis by looking at what other applications do well, and what they do not. I then sat in on discovery interviews with the Product Manager and existing customers. <span style="font-weight:500">This early discovery process greatly helped us narrow our focus and build a product that would fulfill our users needs.</span>

                    <p class="port-blurb">
                    <span style="font-weight:500">We needed to quickly surface our goals for success with the project.</span> Which we identified as such: give our users an easier product to consume the powerful features of the RightScale platform. This was broken down in to several key value propositions: give Admins a portal to design, maintain, curate, and publish Cloud Applications to a Marketplace where users can consume the set of resources; and give untrained users the tools they need to utilize these cloud resources with little to no training required.

                    I channeled our findings in to user stories, personas and requirements that I then rendered in to simple wireframes. <span style="font-weight:500">During this time, I ran a design studio with the entire team so everyone was able to contribute to the design and product vision.</span> It was incredibly valuable to have all the subject matter expects help guide our design flow. We could quickly ask them what the technical constraints were, and what made sense from their perspective.

                        QAD provides Enterprise Resource Planning solutions. The Desktop application needed a Dashboard to give users an at-a-glance view of important data. I began the project with thorough user research. To get representative user data, I conducted onsite contextual inquiries to observe our users workflows. Coupled with competitive analysis, and analyzing user data, we came to build the Dashboard.

                                The Portal Prototype was an integral part of moving QAD’s Desktop Application to the web. Our goals for building the prototype were to explore and answer these questions: <span style="font-weight:500">what is the minimum viable product (MVP) for our users with respect to a web application?</span> What kind of complex interactions, features and functionality can we now take advantage of if we move to the web? <span style="font-weight:500">Is this something our users want,</span> or are they comfortable with on premise desktop software?

                                Our team consisted of a one front end developer, a business analyst, and myself as the UX Designer. The Business Analyst was in Europe, so collaborating was challenging. He helped us with the content, and the front end dev and myself worked on designing the visual design, layout, interactions, and information architecture. We set mini releases each week, and tested the new functionality and designs 1-2 times per week. We found that the steady research cadence sped up our design work flow, quickly reduced usability problems, and improved user satisfaction.

                                During the 8-10 weeks of working on the prototype, we surfaced invaluable information. More importantly, as the months went on, we continued learning from the prototype. It was instrumental in deciding how to move forward with a web application. From our thorough user research, we knew what features mattered most to our users. <span style="font-weight:500">We knew that we had to focus on specific pain points they were currently working around because we didn’t have enough mobile solutions.</span> This was great for our team, and a powerful tool for selling our story to other stakeholders.

I quickly found that there were parts of the system that just did not sync up with our users mental model, and it was astoundingly unintuitive. I scoured through the 20 year old documentation, trying to make sense of things. I was quickly dubbed the GRS expert of QAD, yet I remained unsatisfied with what was still little understanding. <span style="font-weight:500">I decided to talk to internal users. I asked them to walk me through their workflow and explain the parts that were unclear to me.</span> I quickly found out that it was equally unclear to them, and I found some very interesting workarounds they had employed to simply push a requisition through the system. They didn’t know why it acted this way, and they didn’t ask questions. This fascinated me. People using a system for over 10 years, aware of their lack of understanding, yet they brushed it off and were content with not fully understanding it.
