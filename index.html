                     RightScale needed an application to consume the powerful features they provide, but without the steep learning curve. Working collaboratively with the Product Manager, Visual Designer, Architects, and Developers we built a vision for this new product.

                    We began working on Self Service with a tight deadline – 3 weeks to get a functional prototype. Before we began building the prototype, I had 2-3 weeks to conduct my research. This consisted of competitive analysis, user research, market analysis, and a heuristic evaluation of our own application.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I channeled the research in to user stories, that I then rendered in to simple wireframes.

The user begins in the Catalog, launches a CloudApp, and is taken to the CloudApps page where she can use her app. <span style="font-weight:700">This flow shows how easy it is for users to launch cloud resources without being a DevOps guru.</span></div>

This was broken down in to several key value propositions: give Admins a portal for designing and scaling out Cloud Application to design a Marketplace where Admins can provide Cloud Applications at scale to their users; and give untrained users the tools they need to consume these Cloud resources with little to no training required.

                        QAD provides Enterprise Resource Planning solutions. The Desktop application needed a Dashboard to give users an at-a-glance view of important data. I began the project with thorough user research. To get representative user data, I conducted onsite contextual inquiries to observe our users workflows. Coupled with competitive analysis, and analyzing user data, we came to build the Dashboard.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The Dashboard allowed users to add content from several program types across the platform. These included data tables, Operational Metrics, Business Intelligence Charts, Process Maps, and any URL they desired.

                        </p>

                    <h4 class="port-title">Measuring Success</h4>
                        <p class="port-blurb">
                        We validated the Dashboard with several customers by allowing them to be part of an early adopter program. <span style="font-weight:500">By participating in the program, we got continuous feedback during the development cycle that we were able to rapidly iterate on.</span> Our customers were very pleased by the new features, and being part of the design process.

                                The Portal Prototype was an integral part of moving QAD’s Desktop Application to the web. Our goals for building the prototype were to explore and answer these questions: <span style="font-weight:500">what is the minimum viable product (MVP) for our users with respect to a web application?</span> What kind of complex interactions, features and functionality can we now take advantage of if we move to the web? <span style="font-weight:500">Is this something our users want,</span> or are they comfortable with on premise desktop software?
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <p class="port-blurb">
                                During the 8-10 weeks of working on the prototype, we surfaced invaluable information. More importantly, as the months went on, we continued learning from the prototype. It was instrumental in deciding how to move forward with a web application. From our thorough user research, we knew what features mattered most to our users. <span style="font-weight:500">We knew that we had to focus on specific pain points they were currently working around because we didn’t have enough mobile solutions.</span> This was great for our team, and a powerful tool for selling our story to other stakeholders. Listen to thy user research!

                                                Key stakeholders at QAD decided that we needed to release a mobile application. Managers and Executives use the global requisition system to approve and route purchase requests. We were frequently hearing from our users about the different workarounds that they were dealing with to handle approving, denying and rerouting these requisitions while they were out of the office. <span style="font-weight:500">It was clear that a mobile solution was needed.</span>

                                                Being that no one on my team had used GRS, <span style="font-weight:500">I took it upon myself to learn the system. This was really my first project at QAD where I was beginning my work with the design process, rather than analyzing the outcome and mitigating the usability problems.</span> For me, this was very exciting. I quickly found that there were parts of the system that just did not sync up with our users mental model, and it was astoundingly unintuitive. I scoured through the 20 year old documentation, trying to make sense of things. I was quickly dubbed the GRS expert of QAD, yet I remained unsatisfied with what was still little understanding. <span style="font-weight:500">I decided to talk to internal users. I asked them to walk me through their workflow and explain the parts that were unclear to me.</span> I quickly found out that it was equally unclear to them, and I found some very interesting workarounds they had employed to simply push a requisition through the system. They didn’t know why it acted this way, and they didn’t ask questions. This fascinated me. People using a system for over 10 years, aware of their lack of understanding, yet they brushed it off and were content with not fully understanding it.

Our users were delighted with the solution, and <span style="font-weight:500">they finally had a product that helped them to better understand the system. It improved their workflow by reducing 5+ steps to complete a task, and allowed them to use the system no matter where they were in the world.</span>
